MATLAB repository for the fast DoA estimation of multiple sources/targets using a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE). Here is a short description of how to generate the training and testing data, train the neural network and evaluate its performance.

1. Generate the training data using: DATA_gener_DAE_allSNR.m
